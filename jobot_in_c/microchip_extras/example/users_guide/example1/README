APPLICATION:  EMBEDDED "Hello, world!" USING LEDs AND INTERRUPTS

The following sample application will flash LEDs connected to PORTB of a
PIC18F452 microcontroller. The command line used to build this application
is

mcc18 -p 18f452 -I c:\mcc18\h leds.c

where c:\mcc18 is the directory in which the compiler is installed.
This sample application was designed for use with a PICDEM 2 demo board. 
This sample has also been tested using an MPLAB ICD 2 and a PICDEM 2 Plus demo
board.  This sample covers the following items:

1. Interrupt handling (#pragma interruptlow, interrupt vectors,
   interrupt service routines)
2. System header files
3. Processor-specific header files
4. #pragma sectiontype
5. Inline assembly

Details can be found in the "MPLAB C18 C Compiler's User's Guide" under the
Examples chapter.
