APPLICATION:  USING EEDATA AND MULTIPLE INTERRUPT SOURCES

The following sample application will rotate the LEDs of the
PIC18Fxx20 64/80L TQFP demo board, which are attached to PORTD.  The initial
direction to rotate the LEDs is read from EEDATA.  When the lower left button
is pushed, the direction that the LEDs are rotating will reverse, and the
updated direction variable is written to EEDATA.  Analog Channel 0 (AN0) for
the ADC is attached to the POT, which can be used to control the speed of the
rotating LEDs. The command line used to build this application is:

mcc18 -p 18f8720 -I c:\mcc18\h example3.c

where c:\mcc18 is the directory in which the compiler is installed.
This application is designed for use with the MPLAB ICD2, the
PIC18Fxx20 64/80L TQFP demo board, and the PIC18F8720 device.   This sample
covers the following items:
1.  Reading from and writing to EEDATA
2.  Mixing interrupt driven and polling peripheral access
3.  The use of interrupt priority (#pragma interrupt, #pragma interruptlow,
    interrupt vectors, and interrupt service routines)
4.  Setting configuration bits via C code
5.  #pragma sectiontype
6.  Inline assembly
