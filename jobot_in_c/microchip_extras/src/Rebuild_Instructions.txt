MPLAB C18 Run-Time Library Source Code

Directory structure:

lib			Installed library binaries
h			Installed header files
src			Library source code
  traditional		Non-extended mode library source code
  extended		Extended mode library source code
  pmc_common		Micro controller Peripheral library source common to
			extended and non-extended modes.

Build scripts:

src/makeall.bat		Rebuild all extended and non-extended mode libraries.
			This invokes make_genericlibs_e.bat,
			make_genericlibs_t.bat, make_one_device_e.bat and 
			make_one_device_t.bat for all supported devices

src/make_one_device_<mode>.bat  
         (where <mode> is 'e' for extended or 't' for non-extended)
			Rebuild and install the extended or non-extended 
                        processor specific library for the device specified 
                        as the first (and only) command line argument to the 
                        script. This builds startup libraries, and processor 
                        specific libraries for chosen processor.

src/make_genericlibs_<mode>.bat
         (where <mode> is 'e' for extended or 't' for non-extended)
			Rebuild and install the Start-Up code and the 
			processor-independent library which includes the 
			compiler math library, the delay library, and the 
			Standard C Library .

src/make_one_subsystem_<mode>.bat
         (where <mode> is 'e' for extended or 't' for non-extended)
			internally used by other batch files, must NOT
			be invoked on its own.


NOTE: Before invoking these batch files, verify that the following tools are in 
your path: 

         MPLAB C18 (mcc18.exe)
         MPASM assembler (mpasm.exe)
         MPLIB librarian (mplib.exe)

Also prior to invoking these batch files, be sure that the environment 
variable MCC_INCLUDE is set to the path of the MPLAB C18 include files 
(e.g., c:\mcc18\h).
