 Function:         void RtccSetCalibration(int drift)
 
 PreCondition:     drift has to fit into signed 8 bits representation 
 
 Input:            drift - value to be added/subtracted to perform calibration 
 
 Output:           None
 
 Side Effects:     None
 
 Overview:         The function updates the value that the RTCC uses in the
                   auto-adjust feature, once every minute.
                   The drift value acts as a signed value, [-128*4, +127*4], 0 not having
                   any effect.
                   
 Note:             Writes to the RTCCAL[7:0] register should  only occur when the timer
                   is turned off or immediately or after the edge of the seconds pulse
                   (except when SECONDS=00 - due to the possibility of the auto-adjust event).
                   In order to speed-up the process, the API function performs the reading
                   of the HALFSEC field.
                   The function may block for half a second, worst case, when called
                   at the start of the minute.
                   Interrupts can not be disabled for such a long period. However, long 
                   interrupt routines can interfere with the proper functioning of the
                   device.Care must be taken.
