# Sample 'portmap.conf' file
#
# This file should be put in one of the following locations
# in order to be found by the Java Communication API implementation: 
#
#
# 1.  Current directory. 
# 2.  Each directory in ${java.classpath} (ie.$CLASSPATH or -classpath setting).
# 3. <jre install dir>/lib. 
# 4. <jre install dir>/jre/lib. 
#
#
# If this file is not located, javax.comm reverts to default
# port enumeration behavior, and bases device aliases on the
# device paths themeselves.
#
# DEBUGGING:
#
#   If javax.comm is invoked with the -Dprops option
#   it lists whether or not and where it located the properties
#   files (javax.comm.properties, and portmap.conf) and
#   displays the class file name for the platform driver, which
#   it derives from the 'driver' property in the javax.comm.properties
#   file.
#
#   If javax.comm is invoked with the -Ddebug_portmap option, it
#   will display a list of portmap.conf parsing and
#   resolution errors if any exist.  For example, if a DTU is
#   offline and references to it are made, that will be logged,
#   as well as any other mismatches or inconsistencies in the
#   portmap file with regard to the the system at runtime.
