Sun SPOT AirText Demo - Version 1.0

Author: Roger Meike

This application uses the linear array of tricolor LEDs
on the eDemoboard and "persistence of vision" to display
text in thin air when the SPOT is moved back and forth.

The default text says "HI! This is a Sun SPOT". This
can be changed by editing the StartApp() method in 
AirTextDemo.java.

To build and run the demo, do the following:

ant deploy run
