# In order to change those properties, you want to modify your
# local build.xml, and add properties of the form:
#
# <property name="<key>" value="<value>"/>
#
# Or, you can store all your properties in the file <file>,
# and set the property:
#
# <property name="user.properties.file" value="<file>"/>
#
# See the file ${squawk.home}/default.properties for explanation
# about the properties that are settable, or see the documentation
# contained with the build.xml file.
