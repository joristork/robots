    <!--
    
    The master build file lives at: ${sunspot.home}/build.xml.

    If you do not have a Sun Spot properties file for some reason,
    then you can set the sunspot.home property manually.

        <property name="sunspot.home" value="/opt/sunspot"/>

    The behavior of the build is also controled through properties.
    For example, to use a different source directory, you can set
    the property 'src.dir'.

        <property name="src.dir" value="mysrc"/>

    For a complete listing of properties that are used, and their
    explanations, see the file ${sunspot.home}/default.properties.

    -->

    <property name="user.properties.file" value="build.properties"/>
    <property file="${user.home}/.sunspot.properties"/>
    <import file="${sunspot.home}/build.xml"/>
