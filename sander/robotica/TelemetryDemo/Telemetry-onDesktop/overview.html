This is a demo application that provides the basic framework for collecting data on a remote SPOT 
and passing it over the radio to a host application that can record and display it.
<p>
The framework shows how the remote SPOT and the host application can locate each other by the 
use of broadcast packets. A point-to-point radio connection is then established and used to 
pass commands and replies between the host application and the remote SPOT.
<p> 
The host application consists of three main Java classes: one to handle the radio connection 
to the remote SPOT, one to display the data collected, and the third to manage the GUI.
